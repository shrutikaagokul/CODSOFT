# Spam SMS Detection using Machine Learning

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

## Dataset
SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Multinomial Naive Bayes

## Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Label encoding
3. Feature extraction using TF-IDF
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **96.8%** with strong precision and recall.

## Conclusion
The Naive Bayes classifier effectively identifies spam SMS messages and performs well on unseen data.
